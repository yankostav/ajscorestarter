project template:  ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core) WepApi

normal workflow: bundle-css, concat-libraries, bundle-js, and one of these (bundle-app-debug, or bundle-app-release)

Big time saver for publishing:
Since you don't need the files in the wwwroot/app folder or the wwwroot/bundles folder, you can:
Create another solution that uses the "Exclude for Project" on these folders

POINT OF FAILURE:
in gulpfile.js: realtime.localHostPort = "55419";
This port number need to be the same as the app URL in the project setting in order for auto-restart to work properly
